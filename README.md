### Overview  
A statistical exploration of socioeconomic and regional determinants of happiness across the UK, using regression modeling to understand predictors of well-being and subjective life satisfaction.

### Key Insights  
- Modeled **1,000+ survey records** to quantify relationships between happiness, life satisfaction, and regional differences.
- Applied OLS regression and found a significant positive relationship (b = 0.44, p = 0.002) even after controlling for income, employment, region, and social exclusion.
- Model fit improved (R² 0.12 → 0.29; RMSE 2.22 → 2.00), highlighting the robustness of results and regional variation in effects. 
- Identified socioeconomic disparities influencing happiness levels, providing evidence for **regionally targeted well-being policies.**  


### Tools & Techniques  
- **Python:** Pandas, Seaborn, StatsModels  
- **EDA:** Boxplots, histograms, correlation analysis  
- **Statistical Methods:** Linear regression, R² and RMSE evaluation  
- **Policy Relevance:** Evidence-based insight generation for well-being interventions
